# Statistical Analysis with Python

This repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter notebook that explores various statistical concepts and their implementation in Python. From the Central Limit Theorem to the intricacies of time series analysis, this project delves into applying transformations, interpreting regression residuals, and investigating distributions such as the Cauchy and exponential distributions.

## Features

- Implementation of the counting measure and its additivity on disjoint sets.
- Creation of a Python class for handling intervals and measuring lengths.
- Exploration of the exponential distribution, including probability mass computation and visualization.
- Analysis of sample means, testing against the Weak Law of Large Numbers.
- Investigation into the Student-t distribution, Skewness, and Kurtosis within datasets.

## Installation

To run the notebook and replicate the findings, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install scipy
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
