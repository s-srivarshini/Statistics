# Statistics

This repository contains various Jupyter notebooks and supporting files dedicated to the exploration of statistical concepts and their application through Python. Each notebook provides a unique perspective on statistical techniques ranging from basic distributions to complex time series analysis and the implementation of advanced models like the Mixture of Gaussians.

## Notebooks Overview

### Exploring Statistical Distributions and Measures
This notebook introduces fundamental concepts in statistics, including various distributions and statistical measures. It sets the foundation for understanding the datasets used in subsequent analyses.

### Exploring the Central Limit Theorem and the Weak Law of Large Numbers
Delving into two of the cornerstones of statistics, this notebook provides an interactive demonstration of the Central Limit Theorem and the Weak Law of Large Numbers through simulation and visualization.

### Implementation and Application of the Mixture of Gaussians Model
An advanced statistical model, the Mixture of Gaussians, is implemented and applied to data. This notebook illustrates the EM algorithm's usage for clustering and density estimation.

### Implementing and Testing Counting Measures
This practical notebook takes a closer look at the counting measures, testing their additivity on disjoint sets and exploring their applications in data analysis.

### Time Series Analysis: Applying Transformations and Interpretations
Focusing on time series data, this notebook shows how to apply transformations to linear models, interpret residuals, and understand their implications in forecasting and trend analysis.

## Installation

To get started with the analysis, install the required Python packages using the following commands:

```bash
pip install
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install scipy
pip install scikit-learn
pip install pandas
