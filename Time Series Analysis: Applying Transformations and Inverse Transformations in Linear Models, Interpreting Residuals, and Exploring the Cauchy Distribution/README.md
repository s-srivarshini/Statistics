## Time Series Analysis: Applying Transformations and Inverse Transformations in Linear Models, Interpreting Residuals, and Exploring the Cauchy Distribution

This directory hosts a Jupyter notebook that dives deep into the intricacies of time series analysis, specifically focusing on transformations and inverse transformations within linear models, interpreting residuals, and exploring the behavior of the Cauchy distribution. The notebook provides a practical approach to understanding these complex concepts through Python programming.

### Installation

To run the notebook and replicate the findings, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install numpy

pip install scipy
pip install pandas_datareader
```

### Overview
**Analysis 1** begins with downloading World GDP data from the World Bank and attempts to estimate the long-term annual growth rate using regression. It involves transforming the GDP data to linearize the relationship with time, performing regression, and analyzing the residuals to test for normal distribution.

**Analysis 2** explores the distribution of slope and intercept parameters in a linear model. This includes simulating linear regressions with normally and Cauchy distributed error terms, analyzing the distribution of estimated parameters, and comparing theoretical densities.

### Highlights
- Demonstrates how to work with real-world data, specifically global economic indicators, and apply statistical methods to analyze and interpret trends.
- Explores the process of linearizing non-linear relationships through transformations, facilitating easier modeling and interpretation.
- Utilizes regression analysis to understand the dynamics of global GDP growth, providing insights into economic trends over the past few decades.
- Investigates the statistical properties of linear regression parameters under different conditions, offering a deeper understanding of the underlying assumptions and their implications on model reliability.
