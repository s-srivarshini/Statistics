## Exploring Statistical Distributions and Measures with Python
This repository contains a detailed Jupyter notebook designed to serve as a comprehensive guide for exploring statistical distributions, implementing measures, and visualizing complex data using Python. Through a series of meticulously crafted questions and exercises, the notebook delves into various facets of statistical analysis. This includes sampling from distributions, visualizing four-dimensional data, comparing distribution tails, and understanding the convolution of probability measures.

### Installation
To get started with the analysis, you'll need to install some essential Python packages. You can install these by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install matplotlib
pip install statsmodels
```
