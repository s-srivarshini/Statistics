# Exploring Statistical Distributions and Measures with Python

This repository houses a detailed Jupyter notebook aimed at providing a comprehensive guide to exploring statistical distributions, implementing measures, and visualizing complex data with Python. Through a series of carefully designed questions and exercises, the notebook covers various aspects of statistical analysis, including sampling from distributions, visualizing four-dimensional data, comparing distribution tails, and understanding the convolution of probability measures.

## Installation

Before you dive into the analysis, ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed. Run the following commands to install them:

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install matplotlib
pip install statsmodels


Content Overview
Sampling and Visualization: Generate and visualize a dataset comprising tuples from Normal and Uniform distributions.
QQ Plots: Compare the standard normal distribution against the standard Cauchy distribution through QQ plots, examining the behavior of their tails.
Probability Measures: Explore the sum of two probability measures by computing the convolution of their densities and visualizing the result.
Sample Mean Distributions: Investigate the distribution of sample means for varying sample sizes, demonstrating the Central Limit Theorem in action.
Features
Implementation of counting measures and testing their additivity on disjoint sets.
Class-based handling of intervals for computing length measures.
Exploration and visualization of the exponential distribution, including probability mass computation.
Convolution of beta distributions to understand the sum of probability measures.
Visual demonstration of the Central Limit Theorem using sample mean distributions.
Usage
The notebook is structured to guide you through each question and exercise, providing detailed explanations and code for implementing and analyzing statistical measures and distributions. Here are a few tips for getting the most out of it:

Ensure you run cells in order to maintain variable and function definitions.
Experiment with different parameters and distributions to see how results change.
Utilize the visualizations to gain insights into the data and statistical concepts being explored.
